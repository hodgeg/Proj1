/*The rotation(caesar) cipher is an encoding tool used to encode a message by rotating 
    the letters of the message to appear as random letters
- A key is also required to be hardcoded in where applicable
        the key will determine the amount of letters to the right the code will rotate the charachters
        
            this specific code will decrypt a message previously encoding with a rotation cipher when provided the key
